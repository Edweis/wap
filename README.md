# WAP Project

## Test me
 - clone the project
 - in main directory run :
 ```
 npm install
 npm start
 ```

## Features
### Posts
 - Display all posts ordered by their number
 - Ability to filter by tag. Filters are inclusives, meaning that looking for `a` tag and `b` tag will match posts with tag `a, b`, `a, c`, `b, c`
### Post Creation
 - Last post get the higher number, so it is diplayed at the top
 - You can add several tags to a post.
 
 ## Todo
  - Input validation in post creation.
  - UI > Add some text for post filters, add margons where elements are too close.
  - Unit testing.
  - Shallow testing for some components.

## Libraries
 - React >16.8, so I used hooks to leanr about it.
 - Rooting uses a very young library about rooting with hooks, however the lib code is pretty simple and light.
 - Flow and eslint are set for proper coding.
 - Files are structured for scalability.
